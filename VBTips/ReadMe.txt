First I would like to say thank you for downloading "SourceCode from CyberSpace": 
a programmer's productivity tool!

Second, I would like to ask: Please vote for me at http://www.planetsourcecode.com.
They hold a monthly contest for programmer of the month, and I need your vote. 

This application is designed to make creating software applications faster and easier by giving 
developers a searchable database for source code.

Application Features:
	Catalogues source code in multiple languages.
	Extensive Searching and sorting options
	Function import features.
	Microsoft windows design.
	Tip of the Day feature lets you reinforce your knowledge.
	MS Visual Basic error codes table for non-fatal errors.
	File viewer lets you open up and view multiple file types.
	An HTML and VB BAS module template generator.

Cataloging Features:
	Programming tips are catalogued by type (ASP, C++, VB, etc).
	Up to 12 languages catagories can be stored.
	Language catagories can be modified throught the interface without any recoding.
	Tips can be cataloged by language subtype (string handling, math, date & time, etc).
	Infinitely many subtype catagories can be added through the interface.
	Tips can be further catalogued by coding tip title, and keyword.
	Duplicate titles are auto-incremented so you don't have to worry about data integrity 
	constraints.

Sorting & Searching Features:
	Source code tips can be sorted and viewed by title, language, or most recent entry.
	Tips can be further sorted by language and subtype (alphabetically, by all subtypes 
	alphabetically, or only one subtype). 
	Notes about source code can be stored independant of the code: You can store additional 
	comments separate from the source code.
	Keyword searches can be of a broad or narrow scope: You may perform a keyword search in 
	only the title and keyword fields or you may search all fields.

Import Existing Projects Features:
	Import feature lets you search for and import Visual Basic functions and subroutines 
	from previous projects.
	Import searches can be by drive, path or you may browse for the desired folder.
	Import form can save your last path searched.
	Import allows you to copy code directly into the database or clipboard.

Programming Features:
	Over 100 coding tips included in the database.
	All open source code.
	Clear and generous notes (about 2000 lines of notes) 
	Documentation on naming convention used (see modNamingConventions).
	Small reusable BAS Modules
	
Work on this project has been a labor of love consuming far too much of my free time, and now I 
feel it is ready to beta. Or rather, I am ready to put it aside and move onto other things. 
That doesn't mean that you are on your own or improvements aren't forthcoming.
On the contrary, I would very much like to hear from you. Improvements are coming.
Send emails concerning bugs or improvements to umbcifsm@netscape.net.

Improvements scheduled for the second release:
	Internal web browser
	Self extracting executable (InstallShield version)
	More Tip of the Day tips
	More source code
	Import support for multiple languages
	Auto import for multiple functions.
	Help files. 
	Self creating database.

As you can see it is quite a list, but before I add even more features to this, I would like to 
make sure the present functionality is a robust as possible. Your input will help me prioritize 
this list, and if you would like to help me tackle this list, then I'd really like to here from 
you!

	James Fleming.
