### Description

A developers source code database. I built this application as an intermediate project for building a complete application. It illustrates design and human computer interaction techniques, as well as a fully functioning VB app banging on an Access database.
 
### More Info
 
I built this originally in VB5/6 a dogs age ago '99-00 & never posted it on PSC. I dusted this off last week & found a lot of the code examples still relavent. I hope you find some of code useful.

Tons of comments, lots of modules for you to use & abuse.

Let me know what you think.

Being able to store & retrieve your source code more rapidly may increase your salary, enhance your reputation among co-workers and make you more desirable to the opposite sex (or the same sex if that's your thing).
